# CS 320 Portfolio Submission

## Overview

This repository contains my portfolio artifacts from CS 320, showcasing my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The artifacts demonstrate my ability to create unit tests to uncover errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet those requirements.

## Included Artifacts

- **Project One: Contact Service Files**
  - Contact.java
  - ContactService.java
  - ContactTest.java
  - ContactServiceTest.java
- **Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report**
  - Summary and Reflections Report included below

## Summary and Reflections Report

For Project One, I developed a mobile application with Contact, Task, and Appointment services, focusing on backend functionality without a user interface, and verified it using JUnit tests in VSCode with Maven, achieving 100% test coverage. My unit testing approach covered all requirements, including unique IDs, field limits, null checks, and proper updating or deletion operations, ensuring that any change in the code would be caught by failing tests. The tests were effective and efficient, using loops and modular code to avoid redundancy while keeping everything organized, and running them in Maven confirmed that all cases passed. I made sure the code was technically sound by checking object instantiations, exception handling, and boundary conditions, and I wrote tests that reflected realistic usage and edge cases. I primarily used unit testing and boundary testing, which allowed me to verify individual classes and catch issues early, while I did not employ integration or stress testing, which would have been more relevant for larger, interacting systems. Throughout the project, I worked with caution and discipline, double-checking tests, thinking about potential side effects, and minimizing bias by approaching my code as if it was written by someone else, which helped prevent technical debt and ensured high-quality code. Finally, I translated user requirements into testable scenarios, designed modular and reusable classes, and focused on maintaining a professional mindset that balances caution, efficiency, and thoroughness, which prepares me for more complex software development projects in the future.

## Reflections on Portfolio Work

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to interpret requirements, design software, write technically sound and efficient code, and apply robust software testing techniques. Submitting these artifacts highlights my growth in applying unit tests, understanding code interdependencies, and documenting my work in a professional manner for future employers or coursework.
